Dodge, Dodge, Dodge
Dodge, Dodge, Dodge
Dodge, Dodge, Dodge
Dodge, okay
 
Guess who's back, back again
Skinny’s back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to your house dorm
To your house dorm, to your house dorm
Now everyone report to your house dorm
Alright, stop, SwiftStick time
 
Come here, witch and wizards, mount your brooms
Guess who's back with a brand-new move?
And I don't mean "move" as in a new case
Of Keeper frustration accusa—
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Skinny’s got a brand-new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to score goals?
I done plat’d everyone, even Banthanor
And that's not a stab at Bantha
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my goals
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend, dodge, touch your toes, and just fly
Up the center of the quidditch pitch
I teleport when I dodge though
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd see it?
Got a little too close? It's okay (dodge sfx)
Oops, the server lagged for a bit
And everyone saw me score during it
 
Now I’m gonna make you fly
Grab that broom, yeah, boy, touch the sky
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Hey thanks, you found my quaffle
Alright now give it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
I took it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Score crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
SwiftStick baby (Ah-ah), oh baby baby (Ah-ah)
```

 

### **Shony**
**<u>Player Details:</u>**
- Main Role: Chaser
- Platform: PC (M&K)
- Region: Europe

**<u>Quotes:</u>**

> "I'm not goated until I hit a one timer off the floor, onto the ceiling, back to the floor, back to the ceiling, off the wall and into the goal like Shony does."
— *Prophecy*

> "Shony is a god king, he genjutsu’s the enemy chasers with his sharingan, does 7 backflips and breaks the bad guys neck. What were we talking about again? Oh yeah and he scores at the end."
— *Malikosis*

> "Shony is known for his bounce shots and absolutely insane approaches. He is a very, very unique flyer, it's really hard to steal the ball away from him, and he is a distinct threat that you cannot ignore."
—  *Sh0kkey, while casting the MSA Finals*

> Obviously with the tenacity of Shony being a little extra aggressive, obviously he is someone that you wanna point out where he could be at all times."
—  *Flyrish, while  casting the MSA Finals*

**<u>Additional Notes:</u>**

Top #1 competitive Chaser according to fanmade tierlists and match results. Well known as the BounceGod, CEO of Bounceshots, Shot Scientist, and Innovator since I am the most creative Chaser. I’ve invented multiple trick shots and absurd angles. Originator of the *Shony Shovel Shot* as well. Started 1 month after QC released. I haven't touched grass since.

With the variety of my shotlist I'm considered one of the most unpredictable shooters. 

Through my experience in other competitive games such as Rocket League as a former amateur player, I was also able to bring a good overview and understanding of the game and was therefore also strongly represented in terms of priorities, positioning and rotations.

**Quidditch Competitive Achievements:**
- 🏆 LEAGUE7 Season 01 World Champion
- 🏆 1st MSA Season Champion
- 🏆 #1 Chaser / Most Creative Chaser
- 🎯 Inventor of the *Shony Shovel Shot*
- 🧠 Pioneer of multiple Bounce/Trick Shots

- 🏆 Makoon – "The Pitbull" 
- 🏆 #1 Beater in Quidditch Champions

When chaos breaks loose and Bludgers are flying, there's only one name opponents don’t want to see on the opposing team: Makoon. Known across the scene as "The Pitbull," Makoon brings an unmatched intensity and precision to the Beater role, dominating tournaments with cold-blooded efficiency and next-level reads.

With a resume that speaks for itself, Makoon has carved out a legacy as the undisputed top Beater in Quidditch Champions:

- 🥇 Beater 1v1 Tourney Champ & MSA S1 Victor
- 💥 Core member of the #1 squad, Crazy Comms

Makoon’s style blends relentless pressure with surgical control — and when he's on the pitch, you're playing on his terms. Whether it’s locking down the seeker, disrupting enemy Chasers, or taking out opposing beaters, The Pitbull bites hard and never lets go.

- Region: North America
 

**<u>Additional Notes:</u>**

Top Beater from May 2023, throughout every playtest. Unofficially the best place to watch quidditch on my twitch (twitch.tv/RealCypris). Went undefeated in games played during the Season 1 NEWTs (Playoffs). Known to be the beater that manipulates the Quaffle the most, along with being the Crazy Comms PR Manager due to my common sense, logic-based ideologies and way with words.
 
**Achievements:**
- 🏆 Winner – Season 1 NEWTs
- 🏆 Averaged 60 Viewers each time I casted matches live
- 🤖 Creator of QC Stats Discord Bot


### **Lihsir **
**<u>Player Details:</u>**
- Main Role: Seeker
- Platform: PlayStation 5 (Controller)
- Region: Europe
- Number: Irrelevant (To fast to be seen anyways)


**<u>Additional Notes:</u>**

**Biography** 

Lihsir originally started on Team Unown as Keeper but unfortunately the Seeker for Crazy Comms left and joined a different team. That’s where the strategic acquisition phase of LEAGUE7 S1 started with Lihsir being the first and absolutely not the last in the League to be acquired by Crazy Comms.

Lihsir was originally a Keeper main but got bored being AFK in the hoops so he decided to start chasing snitches instead. Lihsir specializes in staying alive and catching snitch after snitch.

With Makoon the pitbull and the great Cypris on his side the snitches are more than free even against other top Seekers.

### **CountTails**
**<u>Player Details:</u>**
- Main Role: Keeper
- Platform: PC (M&K)
- Region: North America

**<u>Additional Notes:</u>**

*A new entry to any form of competitive play, this keeper made a rather silent climb up the player ranks.*

**Biography**

CountTails has been playing games ever since the age of classic Nintendo handhelds like the GBA and DS systems. A heavy interest in emerging computing technology kept this player interested in all types of games. When real-time competitive and collaborative games became a reality, CountTails was excited to try this new way to experience gameplay. Initial experiences with technology, however, were rather unsettling, and a preference for single-player or PvE games arose.

A rinse-and-repeat cycle began with completing story mode on games and perhaps a little achievement hunting before moving on to the next title. It wouldn't be until the first year of college that CountTails would try to play another online game. The sudden change came from an elective class that required gameplay with specific titles to understand the course material and pass the class.

Despite the more recent online gaming experiences required by college coursework, there was no continued play of those games after the course concluded. CountTails continued playing single-player games. That is, until one particular game, known as **Hogwarts Legacy**, displayed an ad for an upcoming quidditch game.

Internal reservations made it challenging to try the multiplayer aspect of Quidditch Champions. It would not be until the Halloween in-game event that CountTails exhausted the single-player aspects and dove head-first into multiplayer mode. It was quite a surprise to discover a small yet welcoming and helpful community that rewrote previous perceptions of online games.

**Achievements**
- Season 1 Champion (March, 2025)
- #2 ranked keeper by MMR (March, 2025)

**Off the field**

When not playing Quidditch Champions, CountTails continues to explore single-player games and has even been looking into retro-style game emulation. The undergraduate studies mentioned in the bio section have concluded and progressed to the graduate level.

**Fun Fact**

The in-game name CountTails comes from a solution given to an in-class programming assignment for an introductory course. It is simply the name of the solution function that passed an automatic test suite. The name stuck because it was the first solution presented that managed to pass all automated checks in front of a live audience. A replica of the snippet is visible at the end of this page.
 
```javascript
function countTails(n) {
  let tailCount = 0; // Initialize the count of tails
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	// Simulate a coin flip: Math.random() returns a value between 0 and 1
	// If it's less than 0.5, it's heads (0), otherwise tails (1)
	if (Math.random() >= 0.5) {
  	tailCount++; // Increment the count if it's tails
	}
  }
  return tailCount; // Return the total number of tails
}
```
