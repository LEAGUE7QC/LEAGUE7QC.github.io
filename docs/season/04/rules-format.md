# Season 4 - Rules & Format

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
LEAGUE7 provides a structured competitive environment for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions players of all skill levels. Building upon our Season 3, Season 4 continues with division-based structure to enhance competitive balance and provide appropriate challenges for teams of varying skill levels. The season maintains its two-phase format:
- O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels): Qualifying round using division-based round-robin or Swiss system format
- N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests): Promotion/relegation tournaments between divisions

## 2. Season Timeline

### 2.1 Season Duration
Each season spans approximately three months:
- 2 weeks for team registration and preparation
- 11 weeks for O.W.L.s matches (within divisions), including Mid-Season Tournament
- 2 weeks for N.E.W.T.s matches (promotion/relegation between divisions)

### 2.2 Registration Timeline
- Season 4 maintains the existing three-division structure from Season 3
- Divisions will preserve their composition based on Season 3 final standings and N.E.W.T.s promotion/relegation results
- Team registration ends one week before season start
   - This time cannot be shortened to allow time for Captains' Council discussions
- Each team needs:
   - A registered roster meeting all requirements in Section 4
   - Completed registration form with all required information
   - Additional requirements will be listed on registration forms

### 2.3 Minimum Requirements
- The league will proceed if at least 5 teams register.
- If a division falls below 5 teams due to team departures:
    - A pre-season exhibition period will be held to attract more teams from free agents (maximum 1 week)
    - Staff may adjust division structure or game settings based on registration numbers
- If a team drops out mid-season:
   - For divisions using round-robin season format:
    - All previous matches involving that team will be voided and removed from standings calculations
    - All future scheduled matches will be canceled
    - This ensures fairness if some teams have played the departing team while others have not
- For divisions using Swiss system season format:
    - All previous matches involving that team will stand.
    - The disbanded team will be removed from future pairings.
    - This ensures teams which have won a previous match against a disbanded team are not penalized.
    - For teams paired with the disbanded team which have not completed their match yet, the team will be credited with a match win with a score of 0-0 as if they had played the team.

## 3. Division Structure

### 3.1 Division Types
- Two divisions (Binn & Bagshot) each contain seven (7) teams. 
- Teams are ranked internally based on regular-season performance. 
 
### 3.2 Division Assignment
- Teams are assigned to division in attempt to keep the competitive balance between divisions even. 
- Returning teams are placed based on prior season standings and N.E.W.T.s outcomes. 
- New teams are assigned based on competitive strength, available slots, and staff evaluation. 

### 3.3 Division Season Format
- Teams play all division opponents once, followed by cross-division games determined by final division standings. 
- Higher-ranked teams receive higher ranked cross-division schedules, while lower-ranked teams receive lower ranked schedules. 
- Divisions are mirrored and matchups are symmetric. 

### 3.4 Division Size & Stability
- Divisions remain at seven teams unless registration changes require adjustment. 

### 3.5 Roster Lock Policy
- Rosters remain unlocked through in-division play. 
- Rosters lock only after every in-division game has been played and remain locked for remainder of season. 

### 3.6 Team Leadership Structure
- Team ownership and branding rights belong exclusively to the team Captain
    - Established team branding from previous seasons has protected status and cannot be used by new teams without explicit authorization from the original Captain
    - A Captain may transfer branding rights to a new Captain at their discretion through a ticket
- Team members may request a Captain change through the following process:
    - A minimum of 2/3 of the active roster must approve the change in writing
    - A formal ticket must be submitted documenting the request with clear, specific reasoning
    - The current Captain will be notified and given 48 hours to respond
- Captain inactivity protocol:
    - If a Captain is absent from all team activities for more than 7 consecutive days without prior notice, Staff may initiate a Captain change process
- Player removal requirements:
    - The Captain must provide the affected player with 48-hour advance notice before removal
    - Staff must be notified through the appropriate channel with the removal reason

### 3.7 Procedures for Handling Large Numbers of Disbanded Teams
- These procedures are intended only for emergency situations where the number of disbanded teams in a division significantly reduces the number of possible matches to be played and compromises the competitive integrity of the division
- The Captains' Council representatives for each division are not limited solely to the procedures listed below and may elect to devise and implement another method to handle such situations subject to the following:
- Any significant mid-season changes to division structure or format must be approved by at least a 2/3 vote of the Captains' Council representatives for the affected division(s)
- If more 1/3 of teams disband in a division, an emergency meeting will be scheduled within 72 hours for Staff and the division's Captains' Council to determine what, if anything, should be done to handle O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s for the division moving forward. If Captains cannot come to a consensus, Staff may elect to have the division continue as scheduled or may implement another solution
- In case of unforeseen situations arising which compromise the competitive integrity of a division, Staff may make decisions as necessary to ensure competitive integrity for all divisions

### 3.8 Team Registrations After Season Start
- Teams may register after season start and may be placed in the lowest division, should that division be using Swiss system.
- Staff will have the final say on allowing a team's placement within a particular division.
    - Generally, Staff will avoid placing teams in divisions where the new team's estimated skill level (based on roster/role MMR) is well outside the range of the estimated skill levels of teams currently competing in the division. 
- Staff may, at their discretion, assign bonus pairing points to a new team joining a division. Bonus pairing points will not be factored in O.W.L.s standings or N.E.W.T.s eligibility.
    - For new teams with rosters which fall below the average estimated skill level for the division, the team will generally be given no bonus pairing points.
    - For new teams with rosters which meet or exceed the average estimated skill level for the division, the team will generally be given bonus pairing points to match the closest team by estimated skill level.

## 4. Team Management

### 4.1 Roster Rules

#### 4.1.1 General Roster Requirements
- Roster sizes:
    - Minimum 6 players
    - Maximum 10 players
- Players can only be registered with one team at a time
    - Players cannot be substitutes for other teams
    - Players must complete current season or be formally removed before joining another team
- Should a team disband, players from the disbanding team will be advised that they can join the Free Agent Pool by submitting a registration form.
- Captains wishing to unilaterally remove a player from their team must open a support ticket and provide a reason for the removal (e.g. inactivity, bringing another player in to replace the player, etc.)
    - In cases of removal for player inactivity, the player must be unresponsive to communications from their captain for a period of at least 1 week. If the player in question is in the L7 Discord server, they will be added to the ticket and given 24 hours to respond. If the player is not in the L7 Discord server or does not respond within 24 hours, the removal will be approved and processed. If the player does respond and objects to their removal, the removal will not be approved.
- Players wishing to remove themselves from their team's roster may open a support ticket to request their removal. The team captain for the former player will be advised of the departure of their player via support ticket.
- Teams must maintain minimum roster size throughout season
    - Teams which fail to maintain minimum roster size will be notified via support ticket. Teams so notified will be given 7 days from the time of notification to fill their roster to at least 6 players.
      - Should a team fail to fill their roster to the minimum 6 players within 7 days, they will be given the option of taking on the first interested player(s) from the Free Agent Pool.
      - If a team is unable or unwilling to find an interested player from the Free Agent Pool and the team is playing under round-robin rules, the team will be considered disbanded.
      - If a team is unable or unwilling to find an interested player from the Free Agent Pool and the team is playing under Swiss system rules, the team will be excluded from pairing until they are able to fill their roster to at least 6 players.
      - Teams with fewer than 6 players at after the end of O.W.L.s shall be ineligible for participation in N.E.W.T.s and their spot in N.E.W.T.s will go to the next eligible team in the standings.
- Each team player must be present in the official LEAGUE7 Discord server at all times.
- All players must use their exact in-game name as their Discord username in the LEAGUE7 server
    - The only permitted exception is the addition of a team tag in brackets (e.g., [L7] Player Name)
    - Persistent non-compliance result in potential disqualification after Staff and Moderation review
- To play in N.E.W.T.s, regardless of division, all players must complete at least one game during O.W.L.s.
- Players shall only be permitted to participate in, at most, 7 matches during O.W.L.s (Swiss), 6 matches (Single Round-Robin), or 12 matches (Double Round-Robin). For example, a player who plays 8 matches for one team and then switches teams may only play in 4 matches for their new team if playing in a division using Double Round-Robin format. Match participation must be logged via official match threads monitored by Staff. A participation audit may be conducted prior to N.E.W.T.s to confirm player eligibility.
- Should a player voluntarily leave one team to immediately join another team, the captain of the player's former team shall have the option of placing a "poaching hold" on that player which will prevent that player from playing for their new team for that team's next two matches. Poaching holds will only be allowed under the following conditions:
    - The player has played at least once for their former team within the team's past two matches.
    - The captain possibly placing the hold will be added to the ticket where their former player is joining the new team and have the option of declaring their intention to place the hold within 3 days of being notified of the player's intent to leave their team.
- Teams may only place a maximum of two poaching holds for the season.
- Should a team fall below 8 active players on their roster due to a player leaving the team on their own initiative or due to player inactivity, they may add new players to their roster to bring them up to at most 8 active players regardless of the roster lock. Players recruited under this provision must come from the Free Agent Pool. If there are not enough players in the Free Agent Pool, the team may recruit any player not on an active team.
- If a new player is added to any roster, their captain is required to inform any other captains with whom they schedule a match within 48 hours of the roster change being finalized
    - This communication must be made before the match is scheduled
    - For any matches which are already scheduled before the roster change takes place or if any are scheduled without disclosing the roster change, then the player may not participate in those games without express consent from the opposing captain

#### 4.1.2 Division-Specific Roster Regulations
- Rosters lock at the intra-division games deadline.

- Staff members may join team channels for observation but will remain muted unless needed
- Recording of voice communications is prohibited without consent from all participants

#### 4.2.2 Discord Requirements
- All team captains must follow and acknowledge all official announcements in the LEAGUE7 Discord
- Captains are responsible for ensuring their team members are informed of all announcements and updates
- Failure to follow important league announcements will not be accepted as an excuse for rule violations

#### 4.2.3 Announcement Accountability

## 5. O.W.L.s Format

### 5.1 Match Format
- Each match is best-of-3 games, winning two games secures victory for the match.
- Teams have up to 11 weeks to complete all their division matches, including a Mid-Season Tournament week (they can complete earlier)
- Teams are responsible for scheduling and completing all matches within the timeframe

### 5.2 Match Scheduling
- Team captains are responsible for scheduling their matches within the timeframe
- All scheduling discussions must take place in the L7 Discord channel designated for such discussions.
- Both team captains must confirm schedule agreements in writing on LEAGUE7's official Discord.
- If captains can't agree on scheduling before a deadline, the match defaults to the default time.
- Teams are responsible for completing all their matches within the 11-week O.W.L.s period
- No maximum limit on the number of matches teams can play per week
- Teams must complete matches according to their division format's deadlines outlined in [3.6 Season Formats](#36-season-formats)
- Failure to meet these milestones will automatically trigger the default scheduling mechanism.
    - If a team has failed to meet their deadline for matches played within a certain timeframe, Staff will schedule a match at the default time against the first opponent on their schedule that has also failed to meet their scheduling deadlines. If no such opponent exists, Staff will schedule a match at the default time against the opponent which has played the fewest matches.

### 5.2.1 Default Game Times
- Each division has designated default game times each weekend:
    - World Cup Division: Sunday at 6:00 PM UTC
    - Triwizard Cup Division: Sunday at 7:00 PM UTC
    - House Cup Division: Saturday at 2:00 PM PST
    - These default times remain in place until captains successfully vote on division-specific time
- These default times are automatically scheduled for any unscheduled matches approaching deadlines
- Teams may reschedule from these default times if both captains agree in writing at least 48 hours before the default time
- If a team cannot make their division's default time, they must proactively reach out to schedule an alternative

### 5.2.2 Scheduling Enforcement Process
- If captains fail to respond to scheduling requests for 48 hours (measured from the initial documented scheduling request), Staff will issue a formal scheduling notice
    - Any response indicating intent to schedule (even without specific details) is sufficient
    - This intervention only occurs when captains are completely non-communicative
- If no response is received within 24 hours of the notice:
     - Staff will assign a match time during the upcoming weekend at default game times
     - Teams who fail to appear at the assigned time will forfeit

### 5.2.3 Scheduling Ethics
- If you suspect a team is deliberately offering only inconvenient time slots to gain an advantage:
    - Submit all communication logs to the Captains' Council review panel
    - The panel (excluding captains from involved teams) will review within 48 hours
    - Teams found to be deliberately manipulating the scheduling process will face automatic penalties:
      - First offense: Warning and mandatory default scheduling for next match
      - Second offense: Point deduction equal to one match loss
      - Third offense: Disqualification from current season

### 5.2.4 Broadcast Scheduling Considerations
- Teams that have opted into broadcasting (see Section 9) may be prioritized for weekend scheduling slots
- Broadcast Team availability may influence final match scheduling
- Teams scheduled for broadcast must adhere to additional pre-match requirements outlined in Section 9
- For full broadcast policies and requirements, see Section 9

### 5.3 Scoring System
- Teams are ranked by match series won
    - Example: Winning a best-of-3 series counts as 1 match win
- When teams have equal match series wins, the following tiebreakers apply in order:
  1. Total game wins: All individual games won across all series
        - *Example:* Team A (2-0, 2-1, 1-2) has 5 game wins
  2. Game Win Rate: (Games Won / Total Games Played) × 100
        - *Example:* Team A won 5 games out of 7 = 71.4%
  3. Point Differential: Sum of all score differences across all games
        - *Example:* Winning games by (+30, +20, -10) = +40 total
- If there is still a tie, Staff will offer resolution options (in order):
  1. Teams available: Play tiebreaker match within 48 hours. If teams unable to schedule a match, a match is set at the default time for the division. If neither team is able to attend the match at that time, proceed to option 2.
  2. Teams agree: Follow captains' mutual decision
  3. No agreement/availability: Staff conducts coin flip

### 5.4 Forfeit Limitations and Tournament Integrity
- Forfeited games will be scored as a 120-0 win for the team which did not forfeit. In situations where both teams forfeit, the game shall be scored as a 0-0 loss for both teams.
- Teams found to be strategically forfeiting matches to manipulate tournament seeding will face serious penalties
- Staff will monitor forfeit patterns and may investigate suspicious behavior
- Teams with multiple forfeits may be required to provide valid justification for each forfeit
- Penalties for manipulation through strategic forfeits may include:
    - Loss of seeding advantage
    - Tournament disqualification
    - Demotion to a lower division for the following season
- Staff reserves the right to adjust tournament seedings if strategic forfeits are detected

## 6. N.E.W.T.s Format

### 6.1 Playoff Qualification 
- The top six teams qualify automatically. 
- Teams finishing 7th–14th enter the Play-In Phase. 

### 6.2 Play-In Phase 
- (Seeds 7–14) Single-elimination bracket. 
- All matches are Best-of-3. 
- The winner faces the 6 seed in a Best-of-3 series. 

### 6.3 Opening Round 
- Division winners receive byes. 
- 3 vs Play-In Winner and 4 vs 5 are single-elimination Best-of-5 series. 

### 6.4 Double-Elimination Stage 
- Final four teams enter double elimination. 
- Best-of-3 until two teams remain, then Best-of-5 championship. 

### 6.5 Seeding & Tiebreakers 
- Non-bye seeding is based on record, then head-to-head, then point differential. 
- The winner of each division receives the bye.

### 6.6 N.E.W.T.s Format Change Due to Division Composition Changes
Should a division face a change in division composition which compromises their ability to play N.E.W.T.s as laid out in [6. N.E.W.T.s Format](#6-newts-format), Staff and the division's Captains' Council representatives will collaborate to implement a replacement N.E.W.T.s format. The captains for the division may propose and vote on a new format per normal rule voting procedure as laid out in section [5. Rule Voting Procedure in the Organizational Guidelines](https://league7.gg/#/organizational-guidelines?id=_5-rule-voting-procedure). If the Captains' Council is unable to pass a proposal for a new implementation of the N.E.W.T.s format within one week of N.E.W.T.s start date, Staff will implement a replacement N.E.W.T.s format. 

## 7. Match Operations

### 7.1 Game Settings

#### 7.1.1 Match Format
- Matches will be played using a 3-Snitch format with a 20-point Snitch value and a 1.4 meter fill rate.
- Teams may mutually agree prior to the match to instead play using a 30-point Snitch value with a 1.0 meter fill rate.
- Any exception must be confirmed in writing by both team captains.

#### 7.1.2 Match Lobby Creation
- Matches will be played using custom lobbies.
- In cases where teams are playing under the 30-point Snitch format as defined in Rule 7.1.1, teams may mutually agree prior to the match to use queue sniping instead of custom lobbies.
- Lobby creation alternates between teams, beginning with the home team.
- The selected map must be agreed upon by both team captains prior to the match. If mutual agreement cannot be reached, the home team will select the map.
- Home and away teams will be designated prior to the start of the series. In NEWTs, the higher-seeded team will be designated as the home team.

#### 7.1.3 Queue Sniping Settings
- Teams must play the map they load into (LEAGUE7 does not allow map dodges)
- If queue sniping fails 5 times consecutively, teams switch to custom lobby creation

#### 7.1.4 Legal Gameplay Tactics
- Any move or technique that is executable within the game's mechanics is considered a legal move, **except as defined in 7.1.5**
    - This includes, but is not limited to: bludger dribbling, backwards shots, hoop sitting and any other technique possible within the game
- Using any obvious bug or glitch (invisible player bug, two players on one character) to obtain an advantage is considered a technical issue. See the [Technical Issues section](#81-technical-issues-and-disconnections). Players who obtain an advantage gained by one of those bugs may face sanction. 
- Staff will not enforce limitations on how players utilize the game's built-in mechanics, **except as defined in 7.1.5**

#### 7.1.5 Illegal Gameplay Tactics
- "Hero Farming" set up by one's own team will be penalized. Keepers may only use the hero kick for the given hero **after being scored on** or when **an opponent was the last to touch** the quaffle. 
   - Holding, kicking (both keeper or one-timer), throwing or punching a bludger at, and tackling the quaffle are considered touching the quaffle - causing a fumble is excluded. 
   - Reserving is still allowed, and the reserved kick can be used anytime, including after a pass from a teammate.
- Violating this rule results in a progressive penalty beginning with 20 points with a 20-point increase per violation (i.e. 1st violation = 20 points, 2nd violation = 40 additional points for a total of 60 points deducted).

### 7.2 Match Protocols

#### 7.2.1 Pre-Match Requirements 
- Teams must create (or confirm) their results thread prior to their scheduled match
- Teams must have all players in their team voice channel, but may remain muted if they do not wish to communicate via voice chat, at least 10 minutes before the match start time
    - Team players are responsible to fix their clients and they must be ready to begin at the start time
- Team captains must be present in the game setup voice channel at least 5 minutes before the scheduled start time
     - If another player will setup the games, team Captain must inform Staff prior to match start time
     - If a team is not present in the setup room within 7 minutes of start time (e.g., by 1:07 for a 1:00 game), they must forfeit the game
       - If still absent by 14 minutes past the start time, the team forfeits the full match
       - The opposing captain must ping staff in real time to claim the forfeit with a proof of screenshot
       - A captain who would otherwise be able to claim a forfeit may, upon mutual agreement with the opposing captain, decide to go ahead with the match with the team which would have forfeited playing shorthanded in a custom match. This agreement must be documented in the queue setup channel to be valid. No bot fill will be allowed for the shorthanded team. Regardless of outcome, the result of the match will stand. No forfeit may be claimed after a match has started under this rule.

#### 7.2.2 Between Games 
- Teams are allowed up to 7 minutes of strategy discussion between games 
- If a team is not ready after 7 minutes, the same late penalty of pre-match applies again for the next game
     - If a previous game ended at :23 minute mark, captains are expected to meet at :30 to start the next game

#### 7.2.3 Post-Match Reporting
- Within 24 hours of match completion, each captain must either:
    1) Submit the match scores in their thread with required screenshots, or
    2) Verify the opponent captain’s posted scores + Final Scoreboard screenshot.
- Verification must be an explicit written confirmation in-thread (e.g., “Verified”).
- Match completion is defined as the end of the final game played in the match.
- Enforcement of reporting deadline:
    - 1–12 hours late: -10  points from team's season point scored
    - 13–24 hours late: -20 points from team's season point scored
    - 25–48 hours late: -30 points from team's season point scored
    - 49+ hours late: Match forfeiture penalty applied to the non-reporting team(s) with -100 season points
- Screenshots required for:
    - Final scoreboards
    - Any disputed plays
    - Technical issues
- Staff verification required for:
    - Disputed scores
    - Technical issues
- For disputes or penalty claims:
    - Anybody may open a ticket within 48 hours of the series end with evidence of the claim
    - Ticket must include any available evidence of the issue
    - If reported within 48 hours, staff may take as much time as necessary to conduct their investigation, review, and issuance of a decision
    - If reported after 48 hours have passed, any match results stand
    - If there is an infraction that still warrants action, this can still be handled with individuals involved (i.e. cheating may still warrant a ban from league participation but would no longer affect match results)
    - If a decision changes match results where a won game becomes a tie, teams must meet within 1 week to play a tiebreaker match
    - A tighter timeframe may be required if near the end of the season 

#### 7.2.3.1 Match Results Changed by Penalty
- If penalties occur in a game, the final recorded score shall be adjusted accordingly
- The team with more points after any adjustments will be declared the winner
- If a tie occurs after adjustments, the team with the fewest penalty points will be declared the winner

#### 7.2.4 Match Observation

    - Staff verifies rosters and game settings with captains
    - Staff remains available in voice channels or dedicated support channel
    - Staff monitors fair play and team communication
    - Staff may record gameplay footage with permission
    - Staff verifies scores and record incidents

    - Teams should maintain their own match notes of significant events (screenshots)
    - Any disputes will be reviewed by Staff post-match using available recordings
    - Both teams must record their gameplay (when possible)
    - The same pre-match, during-match, and post-match protocols apply even without staff presence
- Community members will be able to observe matches muted and deafened in the same voice channels
    - Deafening condition must be provided by the team (this is a Discord perm limitation)


## 8. Technical Management

### 8.1 Technical Issues and Disconnections
- Team captains' **mutual agreement** takes precedence in handling technical issues
     - REMINDER: Staff is not responsible for following mutually agreed rules
- If a player in a team is dealing with a technical issue, their team must spam "*Bloody Hell!*" consecutively (minimum 3 times) in the in-game chat to inform the other team
- Both teams must take screenshots immediately and captains must return to the match setup room
     - Captains are given maximum 7 minutes of discussion time to decide how to proceed
     - If captains cannot agree after the allowed discussion time, the following resolution table is used:
      | Time \ Points Diff | 0 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 |
      |:---------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
      | > 5:00      | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 5:00   - 4:30 | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 4:30   - 4:00 | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 4:00   - 3:30 | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 3:30   - 3:00 | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 3:00   - 2:30 | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C | C |
      | 2:30   - 2:00 | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C | C | C |
      | 2:00   - 1:30 | R | R | R | R | C | C | C | C | C | C |
      | 1:30   - 1:00 | R | R | R | C | C | C | C | C | C | C |
      | 1:00   - 0:30 | R | R | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C |
      | < 0:30 (inc. overtime) | R | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C |
        - R means: Restart   - Current game is discarded, teams replay 
        - C means: Completed   - Game ends with current scoreboard

### 8.1.1 Technical Issue Signaling
- "*Bloody Hell!*" spam in chat is reserved exclusively for signaling technical issues
    - Players are discouraged to use this signal for team communication or any other purpose
- False technical issue claims using "*Bloody Hell!*" may result in:
    - Game forfeiture
    - Match forfeiture for repeated offenses

### 8.1.2 Technical Issue Limits
- Each team is limited to a maximum of 3 technical issue-related restarts per match series
    - After reaching this limit, the team must continue playing regardless of any further technical issues
    - This restart limit applies to all technical issues including, but not limited to:
      - High ping (>100ms) during warmup
      - Disconnections
      - Game client crashes
      - Hardware problems
- By mutual agreement before the match starts, captains may increase this limit to a higher specific number
    - This agreement must be documented in writing
    - More than 5 restarts per team is not recommended to maintain reasonable match durations
    - Staff may force this number to stay as maximum 5 for broadcasting purposes
- Server-wide technical issues do not count against a team's restart limit
    - A server-wide issue is defined as an event where all players are simultaneously disconnected or where significant desync/unprocessed frames issues cause the game to be competitively unplayable for more than 1 minute.
    - These are considered official server problems outside of individual team control
- Important clarification: Map dodging (leaving a match because of an undesired map) is not recognized as a legitimate technical issue

### 8.2 Rescheduling Due to Technical Issues
- If persistent technical issues prevent match completion:
    - Both captains may agree to reschedule the remainder of the match
    - Staff must be informed and document the rescheduling
    - The rescheduled portion must be completed within the same week.
      - If unable to complete within the same week, the team should schedule the match to be their first match to be completed and advise Staff.
    - Completed games' results stand; only incomplete games are rescheduled

### 8.3 Issue Monitoring
- Suspicious patterns result in investigation
- Staff maintains a record of all disconnections
- Multiple disconnections from the same player or team will trigger a review
- Players with persistent connection issues may be required to provide network diagnostics

### 8.4 Patch Management
- There are no expected patches to the game.
