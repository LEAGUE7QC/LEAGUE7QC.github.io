### To all of our LEAGUE7 Champions,

Hello everyone, your Charming Season 3 President Skipper here, I would like to start by thanking everyone in our community, you are what makes the community run and the whole reasons we are here! This season we tried a lot of new things with the play in tourney to decide who got into the World Cup division, our mid season tourney, double round robin, a prize pool for OWLs and NEWTs, and the ban of hero farming. While we did have a lot of success there are still things we can learn from for future seasons, again thank you for being open and trying new rules to keep our game fresh and engaging.

When I stepped into this role we already had a great foundation that I hoped to continue, but we exceeded those expectations. We have had new teams and players make their marks, as well as long time veterans who continued to elevate to bar. Our Broadcasting and Creative teams have done amazing work with the streams and merch, and our Mod team making sure our small community remains a welcoming and inclusive community, as well as Staff monitoring games and revising our rulebook to make sure they are more clear (and much more).

To my successor, the next Head Master/Mistress of L7, you are inheriting a league filled with creativity, momentum, and heart. More importantly you are taking lead of this community who is eager to support you and move the league forward.  My best advise for you will be to listen closely, communicate clearly, lead with clarity, and never forget that every decision you make affects real people who care about this league. 

As we move to Season 4 History of Magic, the future of League 7 is bright, and I am excited to watch it reach new heights. Whether I am cheer quietly from the sidelines, loudly in the front row, or on the pitch, know that I remain a lifelong supporter of this league and all the incredible people who make it what it is.

Thank you all for allowing me the honor of serving as your president.

— Skipper13 ❤️
