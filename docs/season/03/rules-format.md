# Season 3   - Rules & Format

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
LEAGUE7 provides a structured competitive environment for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions players of all skill levels. Building upon our Season 2, Season 3 continues with division-based structure to enhance competitive balance and provide appropriate challenges for teams of varying skill levels. The season maintains its two-phase format:
- O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels): Qualifying round using division-based round-robin or Swiss system format
- N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests): Promotion/relegation tournaments between divisions

## 2. Season Timeline

### 2.1 Season Duration
Each season spans approximately three months:
- 2 weeks for team registration and preparation
- 11 weeks for O.W.L.s matches (within divisions), including Mid-Season Tournament
- 2 weeks for N.E.W.T.s matches (promotion/relegation between divisions)

### 2.2 Registration Timeline
- Season 3 maintains the existing three-division structure from Season 2
- Divisions will preserve their composition based on Season 2 final standings and N.E.W.T.s promotion/relegation results
- Team registration ends one week before season start
   - This time cannot be shortened to allow time for Captains' Council discussions
- Each team needs:
   - A registered roster meeting all requirements in Section 4
   - Completed registration form with all required information
   - Additional requirements will be listed on registration forms

### 2.3 Minimum Requirements
- The league will proceed if at least 5 teams register.
- If a division falls below 5 teams due to team departures:
    - A pre-season exhibition period will be held to attract more teams from free agents (maximum 1 week)
    - Staff may adjust division structure or game settings based on registration numbers
- If a team drops out mid-season:
   - For divisions using round-robin season format:
    - All previous matches involving that team will be voided and removed from standings calculations
    - All future scheduled matches will be canceled
    - This ensures fairness if some teams have played the departing team while others have not
- For divisions using Swiss system season format:
    - All previous matches involving that team will stand.
    - The disbanded team will be removed from future pairings.
    - This ensures teams which have won a previous match against a disbanded team are not penalized.
    - For teams paired with the disbanded team which have not completed their match yet, the team will be credited with a match win with a score of 0-0 as if they had played the team.

## 3. Division Structure

### 3.1 Division Types
#### 3.1.1 World Cup Division
- Top-tier competitive play
- Previous season's highest performers
- Strictest roster regulations.

#### 3.1.2 Triwizard Cup Division
- Semi-pro level competitive play
- Balanced skill level
- Moderate roster regulations.

#### 3.1.3 House Cup Division
- Entry-pro level competitive play
- Developmental focus, welcoming to new players
- Most relaxed roster regulations.

### 3.2 Division Assignment

#### 3.2.1 Season 3 Continuity and Placement
- **Returning Teams:** Automatically placed in divisions based on Season 2 final standings and N.E.W.T.s promotion/relegation results
- **New Teams:** Assigned to the lower divisions based on estimated skill level and available slots in appropriate divisions

#### 3.2.2 Division Preference and Adjustments
- Returning teams may request division preference during registration if they believe their roster strength has significantly changed
- If more new teams request placement in a division than available slots:
     - Priority given to teams with estimated skill levels most appropriate for that division
     - Staff may organize a brief pre-season qualification tournament during the registration period
     - Staff evaluation will consider player MMR, roster composition, and competitive balance
- Teams may decline to participate if not placed in their preferred division, but must notify Staff within 24 hours of placement notification to allow for adjustments

#### 3.2.3 Division Size and Stability
- Division sizes will be maintained from Season 2 structure: World Cup (7 teams), Triwizard Cup (7 teams), House Cup (remainder)
- Adjustments to division size will only occur if necessary due to significant registration changes (more than 3 team departures from any single division)

#### 3.2.4 Division Season Format Continuity
- Season 3 format changes:
    - World Cup Division: Double round-robin format
    - Triwizard Cup Division: Double round-robin format
    - House Cup Division: Swiss system format (unchanged)
- Format changes will only occur if division composition changes significantly require format adjustment, subject to Captains' Council approval

### 3.3 Team Leadership Structure
- Team ownership and branding rights belong exclusively to the team Captain
    - Established team branding from previous seasons has protected status and cannot be used by new teams without explicit authorization from the original Captain
    - A Captain may transfer branding rights to a new Captain at their discretion through a ticket
- Team members may request a Captain change through the following process:
    - A minimum of 2/3 of the active roster must approve the change in writing
    - A formal ticket must be submitted documenting the request with clear, specific reasoning
    - The current Captain will be notified and given 48 hours to respond
- Captain inactivity protocol:
    - If a Captain is absent from all team activities for more than 7 consecutive days without prior notice, Staff may initiate a Captain change process
- Player removal requirements:
    - The Captain must provide the affected player with 48-hour advance notice before removal
    - Staff must be notified through the appropriate channel with the removal reason

### 3.4 Procedures for Handling Large Numbers of Disbanded Teams
- These procedures are intended only for emergency situations where the number of disbanded teams in a division significantly reduces the number of possible matches to be played and compromises the competitive integrity of the division
- The Captains' Council representatives for each division are not limited solely to the procedures listed below and may elect to devise and implement another method to handle such situations subject to the following:
- Any significant mid-season changes to division structure or format must be approved by at least a 2/3 vote of the Captains' Council representatives for the affected division(s)
- If more 1/3 of teams disband in a division, an emergency meeting will be scheduled within 72 hours for Staff and the division's Captains' Council to determine what, if anything, should be done to handle O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s for the division moving forward. If Captains cannot come to a consensus, Staff may elect to have the division continue as scheduled or may implement another solution
- In case of unforeseen situations arising which compromise the competitive integrity of a division, Staff may make decisions as necessary to ensure competitive integrity for all divisions

### 3.5 Team Registrations After Season Start
- Teams may register after season start and may be placed in the lowest division, should that division be using Swiss system.
- Staff will have the final say on allowing a team's placement within a particular division.
    - Generally, Staff will avoid placing teams in divisions where the new team's estimated skill level (based on roster/role MMR) is well outside the range of the estimated skill levels of teams currently competing in the division. 
- Staff may, at their discretion, assign bonus pairing points to a new team joining a division. Bonus pairing points will not be factored in O.W.L.s standings or N.E.W.T.s eligibility.
    - For new teams with rosters which fall below the average estimated skill level for the division, the team will generally be given no bonus pairing points.
    - For new teams with rosters which meet or exceed the average estimated skill level for the division, the team will generally be given bonus pairing points to match the closest team by estimated skill level.

### 3.6 Season Formats
- The two possible season formats teams may compete in are the round-robin and Swiss system formats.
- Round-robin will be the default format for teams competing in divisions which start with 7 teams.
- Swiss system will be the default format for teams competing in divisions which start with 4 teams or fewer.

#### 3.6.1 Round-Robin Format
- Each team will play 6 matches during the season, 1 match against every other team in the division.
- Each match will be scheduled for a particular week, but teams are not obligated to schedule their matches for that particular week.
- Teams must complete all of their matches by the season's end. Matches not completed by the season's end will be considered a forfeit.
- Teams must complete at least 3 matches by week 5 of O.W.L.s, and at least 4 matches by week 6.
    - If a team is approaching a deadline for matches completed, the captain will be notified via support ticket and will be advised of the next steps according to [5.2.2 Scheduling Enforcement Process](#522-scheduling-enforcement-process).

#### 3.6.2 Swiss System Format
- At the beginning of each week (every Monday morning), teams in divisions using the Swiss system will be paired with an opponent using the following rules:
    - Teams may only play each other once during the season
    - Each match win will give the winning team one pairing point
    - Each match loss will give the losing team no pairing points
    - Staff may assign bonus points to new teams joining mid-season
      - Pairing points are not the same as match wins for the purpose of standings
      - Generally, no bonus pairing points will be assigned to a new team if their estimated skill level is at or below the division average. If a new team's estimated skill level is above the division average, generally staff will assign bonus pairing points so that the new team's pairing points are equal to the most comparable team competing in the division
    - Teams will be paired with teams as close to their number of pairing points as possible
    - In case of an uneven number of teams to be paired, one team which has not already received a bye will be given a bye, which will credit the team with one pairing point and one match win
- Teams which have not completed their scheduled match during the week scheduled will be credited for 0 match wins and 0.5 pairing points. Teams may complete the match at a later time and their match wins and pairing points will be adjusted according to the result
- Teams must complete at least 3 matches by week 5 of O.W.L.s, and at least 5 matches by the end of week 6
    - If a team is approaching a deadline for matches completed, the captain will be notified via support ticket and will be advised of the next steps according to [5.2.2 Scheduling Enforcement Process](#522-scheduling-enforcement-process).

#### 3.6.3 Double Round-Robin Format
- Each team will play 12 matches during the season, 2 matches against every other team in the division.
- Each match will be scheduled across the 11-week period, with one week reserved for the Mid-Season Tournament.
- Teams must complete all of their matches by the season's end. Matches not completed by the season's end will be considered a forfeit.
- Teams must complete at least 6 matches by week 6 of O.W.L.s, and at least 9 matches by week 9.
- If a team is approaching a deadline for matches completed, the captain will be notified via support ticket and will be advised of the next steps according to 5.2.2 Scheduling Enforcement Process.

      - Should a team fail to fill their roster to the minimum 6 players within 7 days, they will be given the option of taking on the first interested player(s) from the Free Agent Pool.
      - If a team is unable or unwilling to find an interested player from the Free Agent Pool and the team is playing under round-robin rules, the team will be considered disbanded.
      - If a team is unable or unwilling to find an interested player from the Free Agent Pool and the team is playing under Swiss system rules, the team will be excluded from pairing until they are able to fill their roster to at least 6 players.
      - Teams with fewer than 6 players at after the end of O.W.L.s shall be ineligible for participation in N.E.W.T.s and their spot in N.E.W.T.s will go to the next eligible team in the standings.

Match participation must be logged via official match threads monitored by Staff. A participation audit may be conducted prior to N.E.W.T.s to confirm player eligibility.
- Should a player voluntarily leave one team to immediately join another team, the captain of the player's former team shall have the option of placing a "poaching hold" on that player which will prevent that player from playing for their new team for that team's next two matches. Poaching holds will only be allowed under the following conditions:
    - The player has played at least once for their former team within the team's past two matches.
    - The captain possibly placing the hold will be added to the ticket where their former player is joining the new team and have the option of declaring their intention to place the hold within 3 days of being notified of the player's intent to leave their team.

- Teams have up to 11 weeks to complete all their division matches, including a Mid-Season Tournament week (they can complete earlier)
- Teams are responsible for scheduling and completing all matches within the timeframe

### 5.2 Match Scheduling
- Team captains are responsible for scheduling their matches within the timeframe
- All scheduling discussions must take place in the L7 Discord channel designated for such discussions.
- Both team captains must confirm schedule agreements in writing on LEAGUE7's official Discord.
- If captains can't agree on scheduling before a deadline, the match defaults to the default time.
- Teams are responsible for completing all their matches within the 11-week O.W.L.s period
- No maximum limit on the number of matches teams can play per week
- Teams must complete matches according to their division format's deadlines outlined in [3.6 Season Formats](#36-season-formats)
- Failure to meet these milestones will automatically trigger the default scheduling mechanism.
    - If a team has failed to meet their deadline for matches played within a certain timeframe, Staff will schedule a match at the default time against the first opponent on their schedule that has also failed to meet their scheduling deadlines. If no such opponent exists, Staff will schedule a match at the default time against the opponent which has played the fewest matches.

### 5.2.1 Default Game Times
- Each division has designated default game times each weekend:
    - World Cup Division: Sunday at 6:00 PM UTC
    - Triwizard Cup Division: Sunday at 7:00 PM UTC
    - House Cup Division: Saturday at 2:00 PM PST
    - These default times remain in place until captains successfully vote on division-specific time
- These default times are automatically scheduled for any unscheduled matches approaching deadlines
- Teams may reschedule from these default times if both captains agree in writing at least 48 hours before the default time
- If a team cannot make their division's default time, they must proactively reach out to schedule an alternative

### 5.2.2 Scheduling Enforcement Process
- If captains fail to respond to scheduling requests for 48 hours (measured from the initial documented scheduling request), Staff will issue a formal scheduling notice
    - Any response indicating intent to schedule (even without specific details) is sufficient
    - This intervention only occurs when captains are completely non-communicative
- If no response is received within 24 hours of the notice:
     - Staff will assign a match time during the upcoming weekend at default game times
     - Teams who fail to appear at the assigned time will forfeit

### 5.2.3 Scheduling Ethics
- If you suspect a team is deliberately offering only inconvenient time slots to gain an advantage:
    - Submit all communication logs to the Captains' Council review panel
    - The panel (excluding captains from involved teams) will review within 48 hours
    - Teams found to be deliberately manipulating the scheduling process will face automatic penalties:
      - First offense: Warning and mandatory default scheduling for next match
      - Second offense: Point deduction equal to one match loss
      - Third offense: Disqualification from current season

### 5.2.4 Broadcast Scheduling Considerations
- Teams that have opted into broadcasting (see Section 9) may be prioritized for weekend scheduling slots
- Broadcast Team availability may influence final match scheduling
- Teams scheduled for broadcast must adhere to additional pre-match requirements outlined in Section 9
- For full broadcast policies and requirements, see Section 9

### 5.3 Scoring System
- Teams are ranked by match series won
    - Example: Winning a best-of-3 series counts as 1 match win
- When teams have equal match series wins, the following tiebreakers apply in order:
  1. Total game wins: All individual games won across all series
        - *Example:* Team A (2-0, 2-1, 1-2) has 5 game wins
  2. Game Win Rate: (Games Won / Total Games Played) × 100
        - *Example:* Team A won 5 games out of 7 = 71.4%
  3. Point Differential: Sum of all score differences across all games
        - *Example:* Winning games by (+30, +20, -10) = +40 total
- If there is still a tie, Staff will offer resolution options (in order):
  1. Teams available: Play tiebreaker match within 48 hours. If teams unable to schedule a match, a match is set at the default time for the division. If neither team is able to attend the match at that time, proceed to option 2.
  2. Teams agree: Follow captains' mutual decision
  3. No agreement/availability: Staff conducts coin flip

### 5.4 Forfeit Limitations and Tournament Integrity
- Forfeited games will be scored as a 120-0 win for the team which did not forfeit. In situations where both teams forfeit, the game shall be scored as a 0-0 loss for both teams.
- Teams found to be strategically forfeiting matches to manipulate tournament seeding will face serious penalties
- Staff will monitor forfeit patterns and may investigate suspicious behavior
- Teams with multiple forfeits may be required to provide valid justification for each forfeit
- Penalties for manipulation through strategic forfeits may include:
    - Loss of seeding advantage
    - Tournament disqualification
    - Demotion to a lower division for the following season
- Staff reserves the right to adjust tournament seedings if strategic forfeits are detected

### 6.5 N.E.W.T.s Format Change Due to Division Composition Changes
Should a division face a change in division composition which compromises their ability to play N.E.W.T.s as laid out in [6. N.E.W.T.s Format](#6-newts-format), Staff and the division's Captains' Council representatives will collaborate to implement a replacement N.E.W.T.s format. The captains for the division may propose and vote on a new format per normal rule voting procedure as laid out in section [5. Rule Voting Procedure in the Organizational Guidelines](https://league7.gg/#/organizational-guidelines?id=_5-rule-voting-procedure). If the Captains' Council is unable to pass a proposal for a new implementation of the N.E.W.T.s format within one week of N.E.W.T.s start date, Staff will implement a replacement N.E.W.T.s format. 

### 6.6 Post-Season Tournament for Teams Not Otherwise In N.E.W.T.s
- For teams which are not up for promotion/relegation and are not participating in the World Cup Championship, captains may opt to register their team for a post-season tournament.
- If at least 8 teams register for the post-season tournament, the tournament will be run.  
- Format of tournament will depend on the exact number of teams registered.
- Tournament results will have no impact on future division placement or standings.


## 7. Match Operations

### 7.1 Game Settings

#### 7.1.1 Match Creation Method
- Team captains decide whether to use custom lobbies or queue sniping
- Decision must be agreed upon in writing before match day
- If captains cannot reach an agreement, custom lobbies will be the default method
    - If the current time shows :30, teams switch to queue sniping (to avoid :41 minute mark)

#### 7.1.2 Custom Game Settings
- Teams must use all default 6v6 official settings at Champion difficulty
- Team captains may agree to ban certain maps by mutual agreement, may agree on a specific map rotation, or may use a random name picker to select maps each game.
- Teams take turn generating the custom lobby
- Failure to choose correct settings result in a forfeit for that game

#### 7.1.3 Queue Sniping Settings
- Teams must play the map they load into (LEAGUE7 does not allow map dodges)
- If queue sniping fails 5 times consecutively, teams switch to custom lobby creation

#### 7.1.4 Legal Gameplay Tactics
- Any move or technique that is executable within the game's mechanics is considered a legal move, **except as defined in 7.1.5**
    - This includes, but is not limited to: bludger dribbling, backwards shots, hoop sitting and any other technique possible within the game
- Using any obvious bug or glitch (invisible player bug, two players on one character) to obtain an advantage is considered a technical issue. See the [Technical Issues section](#81-technical-issues-and-disconnections). Players who obtain an advantage gained by one of those bugs may face sanction. 
- Staff will not enforce limitations on how players utilize the game's built-in mechanics, **except as defined in 7.1.5**

#### 7.1.5 Illegal Gameplay Tactics
- "Hero Farming" set up by one's own team will be penalized. Keepers may only use the hero kick for the given hero after being scored on or when an opponent touches the quaffle. Reserving is still allowed, and the reserved kick can be used anytime, including after a pass from a teammate.
- Violating this rule results in a progressive penalty beginning with 20 points with a 20-point increase per violation (i.e. 1st violation = 20 points, 2nd violation = 40 additional points for a total of 60 points deducted).

### 7.2 Match Protocols

#### 7.2.1 Pre-Match Requirements 
- Teams must create (or confirm) their results thread prior to their scheduled match
- Teams must have all players in their team voice channel, but may remain muted if they do not wish to communicate via voice chat, at least 10 minutes before the match start time
    - Team players are responsible to fix their clients and they must be ready to begin at the start time
- Team captains must be present in the game setup voice channel at least 5 minutes before the scheduled start time
     - If another player will setup the games, team Captain must inform Staff prior to match start time
     - If a team is not present in the setup room within 7 minutes of start time (e.g., by 1:07 for a 1:00 game), they must forfeit the game
       - If still absent by 14 minutes past the start time, the team forfeits the full match
       - The opposing captain must ping staff in real time to claim the forfeit with a proof of screenshot
       - A captain who would otherwise be able to claim a forfeit may, upon mutual agreement with the opposing captain, decide to go ahead with the match with the team which would have forfeited playing shorthanded in a custom match. This agreement must be documented in the queue setup channel to be valid. No bot fill will be allowed for the shorthanded team. Regardless of outcome, the result of the match will stand. No forfeit may be claimed after a match has started under this rule.

#### 7.2.2 Between Games 
- Teams are allowed up to 7 minutes of strategy discussion between games 
- If a team is not ready after 7 minutes, the same late penalty of pre-match applies again for the next game
     - If a previous game ended at :23 minute mark, captains are expected to meet at :30 to start the next game

#### 7.2.3 Post-Match Reporting
- Both captains must submit scores within 45 minutes of match completion into their respective threads
- Enforcement of reporting deadline:
    - 1-30 minutes late: -10 points from team's season point scored
    - 31-60 minutes late: -20 points from team's season point scored
    - 61-90 minutes late: -30 points from team's season point scored
    - 91+ minutes late: Match forfeiture penalty applied to the non-reporting team(s) with -100 point scored
- Screenshots required for:
    - Final scoreboards
    - Any disputed plays
    - Technical issues
- Staff verification required for:
    - Disputed scores
    - Technical issues

#### 7.2.3.1 Match Results Changed by Penalty
- If penalties occur in a game, the final recorded score shall be adjusted accordingly
- The team with more points after any adjustments will be declared the winner
- If a tie occurs after adjustments, the team with the fewest penalty points will be declared the winner

#### 7.2.4 Match Observation
- Staff members will be available to observe matches (when possible)
    - Staff verifies rosters and game settings with captains
    - Staff remains available in voice channels or dedicated support channel
    - Staff monitors fair play and team communication
    - Staff may record gameplay footage with permission
    - Staff verifies scores and record incidents
- If there is no Staff to observe matches:
    - Teams should maintain their own match notes of significant events (screenshots)
    - Any disputes will be reviewed by Staff post-match using available recordings
    - Both teams must record their gameplay (when possible)
    - The same pre-match, during-match, and post-match protocols apply even without staff presence
- Community members will be able to observe matches muted and deafened in the same voice channels
    - Deafening condition must be provided by the team (this is a Discord perm limitation)


## 8. Technical Management

### 8.1 Technical Issues and Disconnections
- Team captains' **mutual agreement** takes precedence in handling technical issues
     - REMINDER: Staff is not responsible for following mutually agreed rules
- If a player in a team is dealing with a technical issue, their team must spam "*Bloody Hell!*" consecutively (minimum 3 times) in the in-game chat to inform the other team
- Both teams must take screenshots immediately and captains must return to the match setup room
     - Captains are given maximum 7 minutes of discussion time to decide how to proceed
     - If captains cannot agree after the allowed discussion time, the following resolution table is used:
      | Time \ Points Diff | 0 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 |
      |:---------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
      | > 5:00      | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 5:00   - 4:30 | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 4:30   - 4:00 | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 4:00   - 3:30 | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 3:30   - 3:00 | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 3:00   - 2:30 | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C | C |
      | 2:30   - 2:00 | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C | C | C |
      | 2:00   - 1:30 | R | R | R | R | C | C | C | C | C | C |
      | 1:30   - 1:00 | R | R | R | C | C | C | C | C | C | C |
      | 1:00   - 0:30 | R | R | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C |
      | < 0:30 (inc. overtime) | R | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C |
        - R means: Restart   - Current game is discarded, teams replay 
        - C means: Completed   - Game ends with current scoreboard

### 8.1.1 Technical Issue Signaling
- "*Bloody Hell!*" spam in chat is reserved exclusively for signaling technical issues
    - Players are discouraged to use this signal for team communication or any other purpose
- False technical issue claims using "*Bloody Hell!*" may result in:
    - Game forfeiture
    - Match forfeiture for repeated offenses

### 8.1.2 Technical Issue Limits
- Each team is limited to a maximum of 3 technical issue-related restarts per match series
    - After reaching this limit, the team must continue playing regardless of any further technical issues
    - This restart limit applies to all technical issues including, but not limited to:
      - High ping (>100ms) during warmup
      - Disconnections
      - Game client crashes
      - Hardware problems
- By mutual agreement before the match starts, captains may increase this limit to a higher specific number
    - This agreement must be documented in writing
    - More than 5 restarts per team is not recommended to maintain reasonable match durations
    - Staff may force this number to stay as maximum 5 for broadcasting purposes
- Server-wide technical issues do not count against a team's restart limit
    - A server-wide issue is defined as an event where all players are simultaneously disconnected or where significant desync/unprocessed frames issues cause the game to be competitively unplayable for more than 1 minute.
    - These are considered official server problems outside of individual team control
- Important clarification: Map dodging (leaving a match because of an undesired map) is not recognized as a legitimate technical issue

### 8.2 Rescheduling Due to Technical Issues
- If persistent technical issues prevent match completion:
    - Both captains may agree to reschedule the remainder of the match
    - Staff must be informed and document the rescheduling
    - The rescheduled portion must be completed within the same week.
      - If unable to complete within the same week, the team should schedule the match to be their first match to be completed and advise Staff.
    - Completed games' results stand; only incomplete games are rescheduled

### 8.3 Issue Monitoring
- Suspicious patterns result in investigation
- Staff maintains a record of all disconnections
- Multiple disconnections from the same player or team will trigger a review
- Players with persistent connection issues may be required to provide network diagnostics

### 8.4 Patch Management
- There are no expected patches to the game.
