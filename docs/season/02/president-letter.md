### To all of our LEAGUE7 Champions,

It has been a privilege to serve as your President over the course of **S02 - Transfiguration**. I've enjoyed seeing the League continue to evolve and become more competitive than ever. I'm gladdened that even while Quidditch Champions as a game has slowed down, we've continued to see growth in our players and community. I've seen new players grow their skills to match some of our most skilled Season 1 players. I've seen teams grow close and friendships blossom. I have faith that as long as the servers remain online, we will continue to see our community grow stronger.

Though I am stepping down from my role as President, I believe all of our candidates for President will be more than up to the task of taking LEAGUE7 forward and into the future. I will do all I can to ensure a smooth transition into Season 3 - Charms. Beyond that, I will endeavor to always be available to any member of the community who seeks my help.

I'd like to thank every member of our Staff and Moderation teams for their invaluable work in making LEAGUE7 work. Your perspectives and hard work behind the scenes were, and will continue to be, indispensable to the League and the community in general.

I would also like to thank all of the players. Both for all of the amazing matches I've been able to witness and for all of your encouragement and understanding when we did stumble. LEAGUE7 and the Quidditch Champions community would not be possible without you, and I will always be grateful for how generally helpful and positive the players of this League and community have been and continue to be.

I have done what I can, and it is time for the next chapter in LEAGUE7's history. I am eagerly anticipating another fantastic season, and I hope to see many familiar faces.

See you on the pitch,

â€” Eddy
