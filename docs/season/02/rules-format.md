# Season 2 - Rules & Format

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
LEAGUE7 provides a structured competitive environment for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions players of all skill levels. Building upon our Season 1, Season 2 introduces several key enhancements including,
- A tiered division structure based on team historical performance and/or player skill level,  
- A more relaxed roster management system that allows teams to bring on new players at any point in the season.
- A promotion/relegation system to ensure teams compete at appropriate skill levels. 

These guidelines establish the rules and framework to ensure fair competition while building a strong community that accommodates both highly competitive teams and those developing their skills.

### 1.2 Season Overview
Season 2 introduces a division-based structure to enhance competitive balance and provide appropriate challenges for teams of varying skill levels. The season maintains its two-phase format:
- O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels): Qualifying round using division-based round-robin or Swiss system format
- N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests): Promotion/relegation tournaments between divisions

## 2. Season Timeline

### 2.1 Season Duration
Each season spans approximately three months:
- 2 weeks for team registration and preparation
- 7 weeks for O.W.L.s matches (within divisions)
- 2 weeks for N.E.W.T.s matches (promotion/relegation between divisions)

### 2.2 Registration Timeline
- Divisions will be created based on the number of teams registered.
  - If the number of team registrations is less than 14, there shall be one division.
  - If the number of team registrations is between 14 to 20, there shall be two divisions.
  - If the number of team registrations is 21 or more, there shall be three divisions.
- Team registration ends one week before season start
  - This time cannot be shortened to allow time for Captains' Council discussions
- Each team needs:
  - A registered roster meeting all requirements in Section 4
  - Completed registration form with all required information
  - Additional requirements will be listed on registration forms

### 2.3 Minimum Requirements
- The league will proceed if at least 5 teams register.
- If fewer than 5 teams register for any division by the deadline:
  - A pre-season exhibition period will be held to attract more teams from free agents (maximum 1 week)
  - Staff may adjust division structure or game settings based on registration numbers
- If a team drops out mid-season:
  - For divisions using round-robin season format:
    - All previous matches involving that team will be voided and removed from standings calculations
    - All future scheduled matches will be canceled
    - This ensures fairness if some teams have played the departing team while others have not
  - For divisions using Swiss system season format:
    - All previous matches involving that team will stand.
    - The disbanded team will be removed from future pairings.
    - This ensures teams which have won a previous match against a disbanded team are not penalized.
    - For teams paired with the disbanded team which have not completed their match yet, the team will be credited with a match win with a score of 0-0 as if they had played the team.

## 3. Division Structure

### 3.1 Division Types
Season 2 will feature 1-3 divisions based on skill level.

#### 3.1.1 World Cup Division
- Top-tier competitive play
- Previous season's highest performers
- Strictest roster regulations.

#### 3.1.2 Triwizard Cup Division
- Semi-pro level competitive play
- Balanced skill level
- Moderate roster regulations.

#### 3.1.3 House Cup Division
- Entry-pro level competitive play
- Developmental focus, welcoming to new players
- Most relaxed roster regulations.

### 3.2 Division Assignment
- Teams will be assigned to divisions based on previous performance and estimated roster skill level based on player/role MMR at the time of initial roster submission.
Significant roster changes after registration close may trigger a Staff-led reassessment of division placement to preserve competitive balance.:
- - Existing teams retaining most of their players from Season 1 will be assigned to divisions based on their previous standings. 
- - Existing teams with at least half of the roster being new to the team will be assigned based on a combination of the team's previous standings and the estimated skill level (based on player/role MMR) of that team's roster.
- - New teams will be assigned based on the estimated skill level (based on player/role MMR) of that team's roster.
- Teams will rank their division assignment preference from most desired to least desired division during team registration.
- If more teams request placement in a division than available slots:
   - Priority given based on previous season's final standings.
   - Staff may organize a brief pre-season qualification tournament during the registration period.
   - Staff evaluation will consider point differentials, head-to-head records, and roster stability.
- Teams may decline to participate if not placed in their preferred division, but must notify Staff within 24 hours of placement notification to allow for adjustments.

#### 3.2.1 Division Size and Distribution
- World Cup Division will always maintain exactly 7 teams when possible
- Division distribution based on total team registrations:
  - 5-12 teams: One division consisting of all registered teams.
  - 13-20 teams: World Cup (7 teams), Triwizard Cup (remainder)
  - 21+ teams: World Cup (7 teams), Triwizard Cup (7 teams), House Cup (remainder)
- If more than 21 teams register, Free Agent Pool usage rules may be updated to accommodate new player entry during the season

#### 3.2.2 Division Season Format
- By default, divisions which start the season with 7 teams or fewer will play the season under the round-robin format rules, with all teams in the division playing each other team once.
- The lowest division will start the season under the Swiss system format rules, with teams in the division being paired each week based on current season standings. 

### 3.3 Team Leadership Structure
- Team Ownership & Branding Rights
  - Team ownership and branding rights belong solely to the team Captain.
  - For Season 1 teams, branding rights are understood to belong to the Captain listed at the end of Season 1.
  - Team branding established in a prior season has protected status and may not be used by a new team without explicit permission from the original Captain.
  - A Captain may transfer branding rights to a new Captain at their discretion.
- Captain Transfer Process
  - A Captain may transfer their captaincy and branding rights to another player on their current roster.
  - The proposed new Captain must be informed and must accept the transfer. Once accepted, they officially assume the role of Captain.
  - If the player declines, the captaincy is considered vacant. In that case:
  - A new Captain may be appointed with approval from at least two-thirds (2/3) of the active roster.
  - The resigning Captain may choose whether to retain or transfer the team’s branding rights.
- Captain Replacement by Team Vote
  - Team members may initiate a Captain change by meeting all of the following criteria:
  - At least two-thirds (2/3) of the active roster agrees in writing.
  - A formal support ticket is submitted, clearly stating the reasons for the requested change.
  - The current Captain is notified and has 48 hours to respond.
- Inactivity Protocol
  - If a Captain is absent from all team activities for more than 7 consecutive days without prior notice, Staff may initiate a Captain change process.
- Player Removal Protocol
  - A Captain must provide 48 hours’ written notice to any player they intend to remove from the team.
  - Staff must be informed via the appropriate ticketing channel, including the reason for removal.

### 3.4 Procedures for Handling Large Numbers of Disbanded Teams
In order to address the possibility of a large number of teams disbanding within a given division, the following procedures shall act as a framework for a possible solution. These procedures are intended only for emergency situations where the number of disbanded teams in a division significantly reduces the number of possible matches to be played and compromises the competitive integrity of the division. The Captains' Council representatives for each division are not limited solely to the procedures listed below and may elect to devise and implement another method to handle such situations subject to the following:
- Any significant mid-season changes to division structure or format must be approved by at least a 2/3 vote of the Captains' Council representatives for the affected division(s).
- If more 1/3 of teams disband in a division, an emergency meeting will be scheduled within 72 hours for Staff and the division's Captains' Council to determine what, if anything, should be done to handle O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s for the division moving forward. If Captains cannot come to a consensus, Staff may elect to have the division continue as scheduled or may implement another solution.
- In case of unforeseen situations arising which compromise the competitive integrity of a division, Staff may make decisions as necessary to ensure competitive integrity for all divisions.


### 3.5 Team Registrations After Season Start
- Teams may register after season start and may be placed in the lowest division, should that division be using Swiss system.
- Staff will have the final say on allowing a team's placement within a particular division.
  - Generally, Staff will avoid placing teams in divisions where the new team's estimated skill level (based on roster/role MMR) is well outside the range of the estimated skill levels of teams currently competing in the division. 
- Staff may, at their discretion, assign bonus pairing points to a new team joining a division. Bonus pairing points will not be factored in O.W.L.s standings or N.E.W.T.s eligibility.
  - For new teams with rosters which fall below the average estimated skill level for the division, the team will generally be given no bonus pairing points.
  - For new teams with rosters which meet or exceed the average estimated skill level for the division, the team will generally be given bonus pairing points to match the closest team by estimated skill level.


### 3.6 Season Formats
The two possible season formats teams may compete in during Season 2 will be the round-robin and Swiss system formats.

#### 3.6.1 Round-Robin Format
- Round-robin will be the default format for all divisions.
- Each team will play a set number of matches during the season, 1 match against every other team in the division.
- Teams must complete all of their matches by the season's end. Matches not completed by the season's end will be considered a forfeit.
- Teams must complete at least 3 matches by week 5 of O.W.L.s, and at least 4 matches by week 6.
    - If a team is approaching a deadline for matches completed, the captain will be notified via support ticket and will be advised of the next steps according to [5.2.2 Scheduling Enforcement Process](#522-scheduling-enforcement-process).


#### 3.6.2 Swiss System Format
- At the beginning of each week (every Monday morning), teams in divisions using the Swiss system will be paired with an opponent using the following rules:
    - Teams may only play each other once during the season.
    - Each match win will give the winning team one pairing point. 
    - Each match loss will give the losing team no pairing points.
    - Staff may assign bonus points to new teams joining mid-season.
        - **Pairing points are not the same as match wins for the purpose of standings**
        - Generally, no bonus pairing points will be assigned to a new team if their estimated skill level is at or below the division average. If a new team's estimated skill level is above the division average, generally staff will assign bonus pairing points so that the new team's pairing points are equal to the most comparable team competing in the division. 
    - Teams will be paired with teams as close to their number of pairing points as possible.
    - In case of an uneven number of teams to be paired, one team which has not already received a bye will be given a bye, which will credit the team with one pairing point and one match win.
- Teams which have not completed their scheduled match during the week scheduled will be credited for 0 match wins and 0.5 pairing points. Teams may complete the match at a later time and their match wins and pairing points will be adjusted according to the result.
- Teams must complete at least 3 matches by week 5 of O.W.L.s, and at least 5 matches by the end of week 6.
    - If a team is approaching a deadline for matches completed, the captain will be notified via support ticket and will be advised of the next steps according to [5.2.2 Scheduling Enforcement Process](#522-scheduling-enforcement-process).


## 4. Team Management

    - Should a team fail to fill their roster to the minimum 6 players within 7 days, they will be given the option of taking on the first interested player(s) from the Free Agent Pool.
    - If a team is unable or unwilling to find an interested player from the Free Agent Pool and the team is playing under round-robin rules, the team will be considered disbanded.

Match participation must be logged via official match threads monitored by Staff. A participation audit may be conducted prior to N.E.W.T.s to confirm player eligibility. 
- Should a player voluntarily leave one team to immediately join another team, the captain of the player's former team shall have the option of placing a "poaching hold" on that player which will prevent that player from playing for their new team for that team's next two matches.

- When teams have equal match series wins, the following tiebreakers apply in order:
  1. Total game wins: All individual games won across all series
      - *Example:* Team A (2-0, 2-1, 1-2) has 5 game wins
  2. Game Win Rate: (Games Won / Total Games Played) × 100

  3. Point Differential: Sum of all score differences across all games
      - *Example:* Winning games by (+30, +20, -10) = +40 total
- If there is still a tie, Staff will offer resolution options (in order):

### 6.5 N.E.W.T.s Format Change Due to Division Composition Changes
Should a division face a change in division composition which compromises their ability to play N.E.W.T.s as laid out in [6. N.E.W.T.s Format](#6-newts-format), Staff and the division's Captains' Council representatives will collaborate to implement a replacement N.E.W.T.s format. The captains for the division may propose and vote on a new format per normal rule voting procedure as laid out in section [5. Rule Voting Procedure in the Organizational Guidelines](https://league7.gg/#/organizational-guidelines?id=_5-rule-voting-procedure). If the Captains' Council is unable to pass a proposal for a new implementation of the N.E.W.T.s format within one week of N.E.W.T.s start date, Staff will implement a replacement N.E.W.T.s format. 

### 6.6 Post-Season Tournament for Teams Not Otherwise In N.E.W.T.s
- For teams which are not up for promotion/relegation and are not participating in the World Cup Championship, captains may opt to register their team for a post-season tournament.
- If at least 8 teams register for the post-season tournament, the tournament will be run.  
- Format of tournament will depend on the exact number of teams registered.
- Tournament results will have no impact on future division placement or standings.


## 7. Match Operations

### 7.1 Game Settings

#### 7.1.1 Match Creation Method
- Team captains decide whether to use custom lobbies or queue sniping
- Decision must be agreed upon in writing before match day
- If captains cannot reach an agreement, custom lobbies will be the default method
  - If the current time shows :30, teams switch to queue sniping (to avoid :41 minute mark)

#### 7.1.2 Custom Game Settings
- Teams must use all default 6v6 official settings at Champion difficulty
- Team captains may agree to ban certain maps by mutual agreement, may agree on a specific map rotation, or may use a random name picker to select maps each game.
- Teams take turn generating the custom lobby
- Failure to choose correct settings result in a forfeit for that game

#### 7.1.3 Queue Sniping Settings
- Teams must play the map they load into (LEAGUE7 does not allow map dodges)
- If queue sniping fails 5 times consecutively, teams switch to custom lobby creation

#### 7.1.4 Legal Gameplay Tactics
- Any move or technique that is executable within the game's mechanics is considered a legal move
  - This includes, but is not limited to: hero farming, bludger dribbling, backwards shots, hoop sitting and any other technique possible within the game
- Using any obvious bug or glitch (invisible player bug, two players on one character) to obtain an advantage is considered a technical issue. See the [Technical Issues section](#81-technical-issues-and-disconnections). Players who obtain an advantage gained by one of those bugs may face sanction. 
- Staff will not enforce limitations on how players utilize the game's built-in mechanics

### 7.2 Match Protocols

#### 7.2.1 Pre-Match Requirements 
- Teams must create (or confirm) their results thread prior to their scheduled match
- Teams must have all players in their team voice channel, but may remain muted if they do not wish to communicate via voice chat, at least 10 minutes before the match start time
  - Team players are responsible to fix their clients and they must be ready to begin at the start time
- Team captains must be present in the game setup voice channel at least 5 minutes before the scheduled start time
   - If another player will setup the games, team Captain must inform Staff prior to match start time
   - If a team is not present in the setup room within 7 minutes of start time (e.g., by 1:07 for a 1:00 game), they must forfeit the game
     - If still absent by 14 minutes past the start time, the team forfeits the full match
     - The opposing captain must ping staff in real time to claim the forfeit with a proof of screenshot
     - A captain who would otherwise be able to claim a forfeit may, upon mutual agreement with the opposing captain, decide to go ahead with the match with the team which would have forfeited playing shorthanded in a custom match. This agreement must be documented in the queue setup channel to be valid. No bot fill will be allowed for the shorthanded team. Regardless of outcome, the result of the match will stand. No forfeit may be claimed after a match has started under this rule.

#### 7.2.3 Between Games 
- Teams are allowed up to 7 minutes of strategy discussion between games 
- If a team is not ready after 7 minutes, the same late penalty of pre-match applies again for the next game
   - If a previous game ended at :23 minute mark, captains are expected to meet at :30 to start the next game

#### 7.2.4 Post-Match Reporting
- Both captains must submit scores within 45 minutes of match completion into their respective threads
- Enforcement of reporting deadline:
  - 1-30 minutes late: -10 points from team's season point scored
  - 31-60 minutes late: -20 points from team's season point scored
  - 61-90 minutes late: -30 points from team's season point scored
  - 91+ minutes late: Match forfeiture penalty applied to the non-reporting team(s) with -100 point scored
- Screenshots required for:
  - Final scoreboards
  - Any disputed plays
  - Technical issues
- Staff verification required for:
  - Disputed scores
  - Technical issues

#### 7.2.5 Match Observation
- Staff members will be available to observe matches (when possible)
  - Staff verifies rosters and game settings with captains
  - Staff remains available in voice channels or dedicated support channel
  - Staff monitors fair play and team communication
  - Staff may record gameplay footage with permission
  - Staff verifies scores and record incidents
- If there is no Staff to observe matches:
  - Teams should maintain their own match notes of significant events (screenshots)
  - Any disputes will be reviewed by Staff post-match using available recordings
  - Both teams must record their gameplay (when possible)
  - The same pre-match, during-match, and post-match protocols apply even without staff presence
- Community members will be able to observe matches muted and deafened in the same voice channels
  - Deafening condition must be provided by the team (this is a Discord perm limitation)


## 8. Technical Management

### 8.1 Technical Issues and Disconnections
- Team captains' **mutual agreement** takes precedence in handling technical issues
   - REMINDER: Staff is not responsible for following mutually agreed rules
- If a player in a team is dealing with a technical issue, their team must spam "*Bloody Hell!*" consecutively (minimum 3 times) in the in-game chat to inform the other team
- Both teams must take screenshots immediately and captains must return to the match setup room
   - Captains are given maximum 7 minutes of discussion time to decide how to proceed
   - If captains cannot agree after the allowed discussion time, the following resolution table is used:
      | Time \ Points Diff | 0 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 |
      |:---------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
      | > 5:00      | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 5:00 - 4:30 | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 4:30 - 4:00 | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 4:00 - 3:30 | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 3:30 - 3:00 | R | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C |
      | 3:00 - 2:30 | R | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C | C |
      | 2:30 - 2:00 | R | R | R | R | R | C | C | C | C | C |
      | 2:00 - 1:30 | R | R | R | R | C | C | C | C | C | C |
      | 1:30 - 1:00 | R | R | R | C | C | C | C | C | C | C |
      | 1:00 - 0:30 | R | R | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C |
      | < 0:30 (inc. overtime) | R | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C |
      - R means: Restart - Current game is discarded, teams replay 
      - C means: Completed - Game ends with current scoreboard

### 8.1.1 Technical Issue Signaling
- "*Bloody Hell!*" spam in chat is reserved exclusively for signaling technical issues
  - Players are discouraged to use this signal for team communication or any other purpose
- False technical issue claims using "*Bloody Hell!*" may result in:
  - Game forfeiture
  - Match forfeiture for repeated offenses

### 8.1.2 Technical Issue Limits
- Each team is limited to a maximum of 3 technical issue-related restarts per match series
  - After reaching this limit, the team must continue playing regardless of any further technical issues
  - This restart limit applies to all technical issues including, but not limited to:
    - High ping (>100ms) during warmup
    - Disconnections
    - Game client crashes
    - Hardware problems
- By mutual agreement before the match starts, captains may increase this limit to a higher specific number
  - This agreement must be documented in writing
  - More than 5 restarts per team is not recommended to maintain reasonable match durations
  - Staff may force this number to stay as maximum 5 for broadcasting purposes
- Server-wide technical issues do not count against a team's restart limit
  - A server-wide issue is defined as an event where all players are simultaneously disconnected or where significant desync/unprocessed frames issues cause the game to be competitively unplayable for more than 1 minute.
  - These are considered official server problems outside of individual team control
- Important clarification: Map dodging (leaving a match because of an undesired map) is not recognized as a legitimate technical issue

### 8.2 Rescheduling Due to Technical Issues
- If persistent technical issues prevent match completion:
  - Both captains may agree to reschedule the remainder of the match
  - Staff must be informed and document the rescheduling
  - The rescheduled portion must be completed within the same week.
    - If unable to complete within the same week, the team should schedule the match to be their first match to be completed and advise Staff.
  - Completed games' results stand; only incomplete games are rescheduled

### 8.3 Issue Monitoring
- Suspicious patterns result in investigation
- Staff maintains a record of all disconnections
- Multiple disconnections from the same player or team will trigger a review
- Players with persistent connection issues may be required to provide network diagnostics

### 8.4 Patch Management
- There are no expected patches to the game.

## 9. Broadcasting and Streaming

### 9.1 Official Broadcast Participation

League 7 aims to stream or record all official matches during Season 2, depending on Broadcast Division availability and team participation.
(For scheduling, see [Section 5.2.5](#525-broadcast-schedule))

Only teams that complete the Broadcast Opt-In Form are eligible for official coverage, including:
- Live streams
- Recorded broadcasts
- Studio content
- Highlight and recap features

Once opted in, teams agree to:
- Be in team VC 15 minutes before match time
- Have a screen-sharer ready and available
- Follow all Broadcast Team setup instructions
- Use Discord screenshare or another platform announced by staff

Failure to meet requirements may result in the match being replaced, delayed, or skipped for live coverage. Repeated issues may affect future broadcast priority.

### 9.2 Player and Community Streaming

#### 9.2.1 Team & Player Streams
• Players and teams may stream their own matches, even if the League 7 Live Team is also covering the game
• Personal streams must not interfere with official broadcasts or misrepresent the league
• At least one POV must be streamed or recorded and shared in Discord for review purposes

#### 9.2.2 Unofficial & Non-Team Broadcasts
Non-participating casters must:
- Get **written permission** from both teams (DM, VC message, email, etc.)
  - Verbal permission is **not** enough.
- Mark their stream as "**Unofficial**" in the stream title, at minimum.
- End the stream immediately if asked by a captain or League 7 staff

#### 9.2.3 Conduct Expectations
- Players must act professionally on-stream
- If tilted or disrespectful, players are encouraged to mute or stop their stream
- Streams with harassment or toxic behavior may trigger disciplinary review

## 9.3 Studio Team Content Policy

The League 7 Studio Team produces:
- Match recaps
- MVP highlights
- Stat graphics
- Player interviews and quote features

Studio content **will only feature** gameplay, audio, or names from teams or players who opted into broadcasts.

Non-opt-in teams:
- **Will not be shown visually or audibly**
- **May still be referenced** in text-based recaps or score updates

All featured content will credit the appropriate team or player whenever possible.

## 9.4 Broadcast Compliance & Penalties

Teams that opt into broadcasts are expected to follow through on scheduled participation. The League7 Broadcast & Studio Teams are all-volunteer groups and their time & efforts are a limited resource which should not be taken for granted.

Matches which are rescheduled as a result of emergency circumstance or technical issues should be promptly communicated to Staff. Failure to communicate scheduling changes for a match that is expected to be broadcast or failure to appear for a scheduled match may result in a team being deprioritized or suspended from future broadcast content:
- First Offense
  - Formal warning issued
  - Incident documented
- Second Offense
  -Team is deprioritized for the rest of the season
- Third Offense
  - Team is suspended from all League 7 broadcast content (live & studio) for the remainder of the season
- No-Call/No-Shows
  - If a team fails to appear with no notice, regardless of the number of offenses incurred by a team, teams may be deprioritized or suspended from future broadcast content.
- Appeals
  - Teams may appeal any penalty within 48 hours
  - Appeals will be reviewed by League 7 staff

## 10. Conclusion

These Season 2 rules build upon the foundation established in Season 1 while incorporating community feedback and insights gained from our first season. The division-based structure aims to provide appropriate competition levels for teams of varying skills, while the promotion/relegation system creates pathways for advancement. 

As always, the success of LEAGUE7 depends on the active participation and cooperation of all teams, captains, and players. The league is committed to continuous improvement and welcomes feedback from all participants. Suggestions for future seasons can be submitted through the designated channels in the LEAGUE7 Discord server.
