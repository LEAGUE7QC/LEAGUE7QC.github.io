# LEAGUE7 Broadcasting Guidelines

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope
The LEAGUE7 Broadcasting Team exists to present league events in a way that highlights our players, teams, and community while maintaining professionalism and accessibility for all viewers. These guidelines provide a stable reference framework that does not change season-to-season, ensuring entertaining, informative, and fair coverage for every eligible team and player.

These guidelines apply to all broadcasting and media situations within LEAGUE7, including those not explicitly covered in specific sections. Updates to these guidelines will be posted in official LEAGUE7 Discord channels and take effect immediately unless otherwise specified.

### 1.2 Content Ownership and Participant Consent

By participating in LEAGUE7 events, teams and players automatically consent to the use of their names, team affiliations, in-game likenesses, gameplay footage, and voice communications (when in official LEAGUE7 channels) across all platforms where LEAGUE7 operates, including live broadcasts, pre-recorded content, and social media.
